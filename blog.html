	  <h3>"My son was addicted to the Internet": A mother's story of the battle to save her teenager's life from online gaming</h3>
	  <p>When my son was 17, he came to my bedroom one evening for a rare heart-to-heart. "Mum, I want to stop. I need to stop. But I’m scared of upsetting people." I knew Connor’s three-year addiction to computer gaming had been ruining his life.<br>My son, Connor, was a talented musician and athlete with a bright future ahead of him. But when he discovered online gaming, everything changed. He became withdrawn, stopped attending school, and spent all of his time playing games on the computer.

At first, I didn't realize the severity of his addiction. I tried to limit his internet use and encourage him to participate in other activities, but he always found a way to sneak back to the computer.

As his addiction worsened, I had to take drastic measures. I quit my job to be home with him more, but he still found ways to sneak online. He even went missing for a week at one point, and I had to call the police to find him.

Eventually, Connor's addiction became so severe that he needed professional help. He attended an addiction treatment center and began therapy. It was a long and difficult journey, but with the support of our family and the professionals who helped us, Connor was able to overcome his addiction.

Now, Connor is doing well. He's back in school and has a part-time job. He still enjoys playing games, but he's learned to balance his online activities with real-life responsibilities and hobbies.

As a mother, I hope that sharing my story will help others recognize the signs of internet addiction and get the help they need.<br><br>https://nationalpost.com/health/my-son-was-addicted-to-the-internet-a-mothers-story-of-the-battle-to-save-her-teens-life-from-online-gaming</p>
